// Snapshot Interpolation: https://gafferongames.com/post/snapshot_interpolation/
//
// Base class for NetworkTransform and NetworkTransformChild.
// => simple unreliable sync without any interpolation for now.
// => which means we don't need teleport detection either
//
// NOTE: several functions are virtual in case someone needs to modify a part.
//
// Channel: uses UNRELIABLE at all times.
// -> out of order packets are dropped automatically
// -> it's better than RELIABLE for several reasons:
//    * head of line blocking would add delay
//    * resending is mostly pointless
//    * bigger data race:
//      -> if we use a Cmd() at position X over reliable
//      -> client gets Cmd() and X at the same time, but buffers X for bufferTime
//      -> for unreliable, it would get X before the reliable Cmd(), still
//         buffer for bufferTime but end up closer to the original time
